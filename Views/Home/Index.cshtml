            <h4>About the Studio</h4>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em">
                Our organ studio offers structured instruction in organ performance and technique. 
                Students will study a range of repertoire, from classical works to modern compositions, 
                while building a strong foundation in music theory and performance practice. 
                Lessons are designed for both aspiring recitalists and church organists.
            </p>

            <h5>Overview of Instruction Style</h5>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em">
                We emphasize individualized instruction tailored to each student’s goals. 
                Lessons combine hands-on practice with guidance in musical interpretation, 
                sight-reading, and improvisation. 
                Students also gain exposure to different styles of organ music, preparing them
                for both recital and liturgical performance. We aim to cultivate not just skill,
                but confidence and a lifelong appreciation for the instrument.
            </p>

            <h5>Primary Focus for New Organists</h5>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em">
                Our studio primarily focuses on helping new organists become confident and capable 
                on church organs. Lessons begin with repertoire from the LDS hymnal, giving students 
                practical experience and a strong foundation in congregational playing. 
                By the time students progress, they are well-equipped to support services and participate 
                in a variety of church music settings.
